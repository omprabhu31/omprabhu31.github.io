'Solid Mechanics Lab' is a core course in the mechanical department in the 4<sup>th</sup> semester. The experiments cover some of the most important areas of mechanical engineering and are primarily based on the theory covered in the courses ME 201 (Solid Mechanics) and ME 202 (Strength of Materials). 

Here are the lab reports I made during the time I had taken the course. Kindly take these with a pinch of salt as the experiment numbers, contents and mode of evaluation are likely to be different for you.
