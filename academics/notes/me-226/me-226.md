'Mechanical Measurements' is a core course in the mechanical department in the 4<sup>th</sup> semester. At first sight, it sounds like a fairly trivial subject - however, this course delves quite deep into the ideation and error analysis of measuring instruments, measurement techniques in thermal, fluid and solid mechanics and a little bit of electronic devices like op amps.

As for notes, the majority of problems you will encounter will be fairly mathematical. I am preparing a small formula sheet with a little bit of theory, but it will take me some time to make that.

I am also posting fairly detailed solutions to the homeworks (hopefully, I will be able to maintain that level of detail throughout the course duration).
