'Strength of Materials' is a core course in the mechanical department in the 4<sup>th</sup> semester and, personally, my favourite course in this semester. It is somewhat an extension of ME 201 (Solid Mechanics) and deals with torsion, bending, deflections of beams, buckling of columns, energy methods and a little bit of elasticity.

This page contains a brief compilation of my notes in this course. I will try to go into as much theory as possible while also keeping the notes concise enough so you don't fall asleep. These notes will be updated from time to time - hit me up if they aren't.

</ul>

I am still undecided on whether to post tutorial solutions - I most probably will down the line, but they will definitely be handwritten (incorporating FBDs in `LaTeX` is quite a daunting task).
