Seems like you wanna know more about me (wink wink)! For starters, my name is Om Prabhu. I'm currently an undergrad at the <a href="https://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/">Department of Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay</a>.

I love playing video games (any genre, but I prefer story rich stuff the most). I honestly believe that video games are the best form of entertainment (more about that sometime later), and personally they help refresh my mind and concentrate on other things for longer durations. Some of my favourite titles are <a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/life-is-strange"><i>Life is Strange</i></a>, <a href="http://www.giantsparrow.com/games/finch/"><i>What Remains of Edith Finch</i></a>, <a href="https://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/"><i>Limbo</i></a> and <a href="http://www.thefirsttree.com/"><i>The First Tree</i></a>. On a side note, I'm also currently taking a set of courses in Game Design and Development.

Here's a sneak peak from my Steam art gallery:

Apart from playing games, I listen to music (like seriously, a lot of it). Here is my [Favourites](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71jTfHYeJXhq0u1iFzOzkI?si=SnhE73jDTbCbBvR3R2hOOg) playlist on Spotify. I've also made a little [collaborative playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CtKpwGpbBcniahdVdW7dw?si=BWD67UA6RAurdlvGWxC8Ww) where you guys can add some cool songs. 

And finally, I love watching PewDiePie (I practically grew up watching his videos and no, I'm not an anti-nationalist). That's it for now, more in my later blog posts. Adi√≥s amigos, stay safe!
