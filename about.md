Seems like you wanna know more about me (wink wink)! For starters, my name is Om Prabhu. I'm currently a dual degree student at the <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/">Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay</a>.

I love playing video games (any genre, but I prefer story rich stuff the most). I honestly believe that video games are the best form of entertainment (more about that sometime later), and personally they help refresh my mind and concentrate on other slightly boring stuff. Some of my favourite titles are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption"><i>Red Dead Redemption</i></a> series, <a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/life-is-strange"><i>Life is Strange</i></a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario"><i>Super Mario</i></a> series and <a href="https://ducky-dev.itch.io/kyle-is-famous"><i>Kyle is Famous</i></a>. I also love platformers (and I also suck at platformers ;-;). On a side note, I'm also currently taking a set of online courses in Game Design and Development.

Here's a sneak peak from my Steam art gallery:

Apart from playing games, I listen to music (like seriously, a lot of it). Here is my [Favourites](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71jTfHYeJXhq0u1iFzOzkI?si=SnhE73jDTbCbBvR3R2hOOg) playlist on Spotify. And finally, I love watching PewDiePie (I practically grew up watching his videos) and videogamedunkey. That's it for now, more in my later blog posts. Adi√≥s amigos, stay safe!
