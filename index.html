<p>Hello, you've reached my website! I intend to use this website mainly as a repository for my academic work, along with occasional blog posts and some other stuff I haven't yet figured out. The website is still in the works, so there might not be a lot to see right now. Hopefully that will change soon. Your feedback is always welcome :)</p>

<p>The general structure of the website is inspired by <a href="https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/">Aryaman Maithani</a>'s website. Credits for edits (hehe) suggested by others can be found in the website <a href="https://omprabhu31.github.io/changelog/">changelog</a>.</p>
