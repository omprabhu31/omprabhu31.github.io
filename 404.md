You seem lost. Don't worry, it happens. You might wanna get back on track by going back to the [home page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/).

Was it a broken hyperlink that brought you here? If that is the case, please contact me using any of the options on [this page](/contact/).

In case you've seen it all, here's a list of fun things to do:

* wonder about your existence
* find out how to bring back dinosaurs
* read about the CS0103 error [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206139166-What-is-CS0103-#:~:text=CS0103%20is%20caused%20when%20you%20are%20using%20a,name%20%60displayFirstName%27%20does%20not%20exist%20in%20the%20current)

* invent a new language (and teach me later!)
* figure out if Scrodinger's cat is alive or dead
* file your taxes (wait what you don't? oh, it's a secret, got it :D)

* idk man just figure out some cool stuff to do

In case you aren't interested in this stuff (I don't see why you wouldn't be, but you do you), you might wanna indulge in this [fun activity]().
