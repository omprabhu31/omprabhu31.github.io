Statistically, there is a 0.00364% chance you willingly visited this page (source: trust me bro). So long story short, you seem lost. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. You might wanna get back on track by going back to the [home page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/).

Was it a broken hyperlink that brought you here? If that is the case, please contact me using any of the options on [this page](/contact/).

In case you've seen it all, here's a list of fun things to do:

* wonder about your existence
* find out how to bring back dinosaurs
* speaking of dinosaurs, get a new highscore on the chrome dino game
* invent a new language (and teach me later!)
* figure out if Scrodinger's cat is alive or dead
* file your taxes (wait what you don't? oh, it's a secret, got it :D)
* take a nap and dream that you got good grades in college
* play <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>
* write and publish a bestbeller book
* make a lot of money
* idk man just figure out some cool stuff to do

In case you aren't interested in this stuff (I don't see why you wouldn't be, but you do you), you might wanna indulge in this [extremely fun activity]().
