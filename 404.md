You seem lost. Don't worry, it happens. You might wanna get back on track by going back to the [home page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/gamedev/).

In case you've seen it all, here's a list of fun things to do:

* wonder about your existence
* find out a way to bring back dinosaurs
* read about the CS0103 error [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206139166-What-is-CS0103-#:~:text=CS0103%20is%20caused%20when%20you%20are%20using%20a,name%20%60displayFirstName%27%20does%20not%20exist%20in%20the%20current)
* switch off your internet connection and get a new highscore on the Chrome dino minigame
* invent a new language (and teach me later!)
* figure out if Scrodinger's cat is alive or dead
* make a girlfriend (pfft)
* take a nap and dream that you got good grades in college
* write and publish a bestbeller book
* add lots of potassium to water
* idk man just figure out some cool stuff to do

In case you aren't interested in this stuff (I don't see why you wouldn't be but you do you), you might wanna check out this really [cool video]().
