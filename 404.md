There are approximately 1.98 billion webpages on the internet. This is not one of them. Well, technically it exists (or does it?). You're here right now, aren't you? But you didn't intend to be here (unless you did, which is a whole separate conversation we won't be going into just yet). So as the math dictates, there is a 0.000364% chance you willingly visited this page (please do not verify that). 

Anyway, long story short, you seem lost. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Was it a broken hyperlink that brought you here? If that is the case, please contact me using any of the options on [this page](/contact/). If not, you might wanna get back on track by going to the [home page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/). 

In case you've seen it all, here's a list of fun things to do:

* wonder about your existence
* find out how to bring back dinosaurs
* speaking of dinosaurs, get a new highscore on the chrome dino game
* invent a new language (and teach me later!)
* figure out if Scrodinger's cat is alive or dead
* file your taxes (wait what you don't? oh, it's a secret, got it :D)
* take a nap and dream that you got good grades in college
* play <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>
* write and publish a bestbeller book
* make a lot of money
* idk man just figure out some cool stuff to do

In case you aren't interested in this stuff (I don't see why you wouldn't be, but you do you), you might wanna [try this](/hi.jpg) (it is not a rickroll, I don't do cheapo tricks).
