Uh, this is <i>strange</i>, but according to my sources the page you're tryna access doesn't exist. Well, unless you came for the error page (betcha didn't think I'd take the efforts to design a custom error page huh).

One thing you might wanna consider doing is starting over at the <a href="https://omprabhu31.github.io">home page</a>. In case you've seen it all, here's a list of fun things to do:
<ul>
<li>wonder about your existence</li>
<li>find out a way to bring back dinosaurs</li>
<li>switch off your internet connection and get a new highscore on the Chrome dino minigame</li>
<li>invent a new language (and teach me later!)</li>
<li>figure out if Scrodinger's cat is alive or dead</li>
<li>make a girlfriend (pfft)</li>
<li>take a nap and dream that you got good grades in college</li>
<li>write and publish a bestbeller book</li>
<li>add lots of potassium to water</li>
<li>idk man just figure out some cool stuff to do</li>
</ul>

In case you aren't interested in this stuff (I don't see why you wouldn't be but you do you), you might wanna check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this really cool video</a>.
