# Hello

This is the github repository for my website. Here, you can find all the files used to make it.

The [layout](https://rohanchandra.github.io/type-theme/) of the website has been borrowed from [rohanchandra](https://github.com/rohanchandra/). Hosted by Github Pages.

## Usage

You may reuse any materials in this repo if you want to, provided it acknowledges me in some way. However if you intend on building your own website using the theme I've used, that might not be the best idea. To do so, you can refer to [this repo](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme/) for a quick tutorial on how to import the theme to your website repo.
