# Hello!

You've reached the github repository for my website. Here, you can find all the files used to make it.

The [layout](https://rohanchandra.github.io/type-theme/) of the website has been borrowed from [rohanchandra](https://github.com/rohanchandra/) and further edited a little bit to my liking. Hosted by Github Pages.

## Usage

You may reuse any material in this repo for personal use and/or modification. However if you intend on building your own website by forking this repo, that might not be the best idea. To do so, you can refer to [this repo](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme/) for a quick tutorial on how to import the theme to your website repo.
