Hello, you've reached my website! I intend to use this space mainly as a repository for my academic work, along with occasional blog posts and some other stuff I haven't yet figured out. Feel free to explore, though I'm afraid there's not an awful lot to see right now. The website is still in the works - hopefully that will change soon. Your feedback is always welcome!

The general layout of the website is inspired by [Aryaman Maithani's](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/) website. Credits for edits (hehe) suggested by others can be found in the website [changelog](/changelog/).
