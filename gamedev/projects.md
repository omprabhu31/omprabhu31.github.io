Here are some of my projects in Unity3D along with their respective project files. Feel free to check them out as well as have a little fun with the games. Note that most web browsers do not support WebGL content. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions or feedback, please contact me [here](https://forms.gle/za5hyQ4nHnz6FT7R6) and I will make sure to fix them at the earliest.

> <h3>Solar System Simulation</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2019.4.2f1</i>
>
> This is a simple solar system simulation - my first project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course. Technically it's not a game, but it introduces many important Unity3D concepts. It ain't much, but it's honest work!

> <h3>Roller Madness</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2017.4.40f1</i>
>
> This is my second project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course - this is where many theory concepts actually come into action while building out a simple but fully functional game. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding enemies or the death zone.

> <h3>Box Shooter</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 5.6.7f1</i>
>
> This is my final project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course - this is where earlier design concepts along with basic programming come together to produce a simple first person shooter. The goal is to reach the target score before time runs out.
